        <p>Data is becoming one of the most sought-after resources in todays economy. With the coming of Industry 4.0, it is possible to collect data from within our environment at a rate which has never been seen before. Environmental data allows us to understand how efficiently we are using the buildings we occupy and enables us to act to reduce energy usage.</p>

        <p>Smart Sense is an end-to-end system that allows the user to wirelessly monitor the environment in which it is installed. A range of wireless sensors collect environmental data such as temperature, humidity and light levels. This is then sent via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a gateway where it is aggregated and sent via an MQTT broker to a data base. The Cloud Platform parses the data and displays it in a simple to read chart. To learn more about the system architecture of the Smart Sense system, please navigate to the "About" page. To see historical and live data from sensors currently deployed, 
    	please navigate to the "Charts" page.</p>
     
        <p>Oliver Walsh has created this system as part of his final year project for his Computer and Communications Engineering Degree in DIT. </p>
